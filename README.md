# Alecsandar cosmetics

This project is made for my first QA testing portfolio. 
For this project, I used the website Alexandar cosmetics. 
I tested the Functionality with the tool selenium webdriver. 
In this project, I used Python Programming Language.

Through this testing flow, I used many different locators, like Locator By ID, LINK TEXT, and CSS SELECTOR, but most, I used Locator by XPATH.
During the testing flow, I used two types of waits supported by WebDriver. Implicitly wait and time sleep. 
The methods which I used are is_displayed(), send.keys(), click(), execute_script(), maximize_window(), time sleep(),... 
I tested several cases, Home page, Login page and Online shop, which are the most critical parts of the site.

At the end of one test case, I used assert statement and if statement.
